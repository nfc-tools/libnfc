 - nfc-mfclassic: take care of 16-blocks-long sectors of Mifare Classic 4K in the nfc-mfclassic example's blocks counting routine.
 - nfc-mfclassic: now fails ealier when something goes wrong (this allow to prevent from false-success).
 - nfc-mfclassic: disable ISO14443-4 auto-switching in order to read devices that emulate Mifare Classic with ISO14443-4 compliance.(e.g. Nokia 6212 Classic)

Note: This release will not install extra headers (like mifare.h), programs that depends on should copy theses files into their sources.
