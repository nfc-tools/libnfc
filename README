General Information
===================

libnfc is a library which allows userspace application access to NFC devices.

The official web site is:
  http://www.libnfc.org/

The official forum site is:
  http://www.libnfc.org/community/

The official development site is:
  http://libnfc.googlecode.com/

Important note: this file covers POSIX systems, for Windows please read README-Windows.txt

Requirements
============

Some NFC drivers depends on third party software:

* pn53x_usb:

   - libusb-0.1 http://libusb.sf.net

* acr122:

   - pcsc-lite http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/

The regression test suite depend on the cutter framework:
http://cutter.sf.net

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'

How to report bugs
==================

To report a bug, visit http://code.google.com/p/libnfc/issues/list and fill
out a bug report form.

If you have questions, remarks, we encourage you to post this in the developers
community: 
http://www.libnfc.org/community

Please make sure to include:

* The version of libnfc

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  Please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches can be posted to http://code.google.com/p/libnfc/issues/list or
can be sent directly to libnfc's developers: http://www.libnfc.org/contact

If the patch fixes a bug, it is usually a good idea to include
all the information described in "How to Report Bugs".

Building
========

It should be as simple as running these two commands:

./configure
make

Troubleshooting
===============

Touchatag/ACR122:
-----------------
If your Touchatag or ACR122 device fails being detected by libnfc, make sure
that PCSC-lite daemon (pcscd) is installed and is running.

If your Touchatag or ACR122 device fails being detected by PCSC-lite daemon
(pcsc_scan doesn't see anything) then try removing the bogus firmware detection
of libccid: edit libccid_Info.plist configuration file (usually
/etc/libccid_Info.plist) and locate "<key>ifdDriverOptions</key>", turn
"<string>0x0000</string>" value into 0x0004 to allow bogus devices and restart
pcscd daemon.

ACR122:
-------
Using an ACR122 device with libnfc and without tag (e.g. to use NFCIP modes or
card emulation) needs yet another PCSC-lite tweak: You need to allow usage of
CCID Exchange command.  To do this, edit libccid_Info.plist configuration file
(usually /etc/libccid_Info.plist) and locate "<key>ifdDriverOptions</key>",
turn "<string>0x0000</string>" value into 0x0001 to allow CCID exchange or
0x0005 to allow CCID exchange and bogus devices (cf previous remark) and
restart pcscd daemon.

Warning: if you use ACS CCID drivers (acsccid), configuration file is located
in something like: /usr/lib/pcsc/drivers/ifd-acsccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist

SCL3711:
--------
Libnfc cannot be used concurrently with the PCSC proprietary driver of SCL3711.
Two possible solutions:
* Either you don't install SCL3711 driver at all
* Or you stop the PCSC daemon when you want to use libnfc-based tools
