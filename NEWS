New in 1.7.0:

Drivers:

API Changes:

  * New function iso14443b_crc_append()

New in 1.7.0-rc7:

Drivers:

  * New PN532 over SPI driver, see contrib/libnfc/pn532_spi_on_rpi.conf.sample

API Changes:

  * Functions
    - nfc_initiator_target_is_present() & str_nfc_target():
      now take a pointer to nfc_target as argument
    - nfc_init(): upon malloc error, doesn't force exit() anymore
      so now you should test if context != NULL after nfc_init() call

New in 1.7.0-rc5:

  * Functions
    - New nfc_register_driver() function allowing to hook custom drivers.

New in 1.7.0-rc3:

New in 1.7.0-rc2:

Configuration:
  libnfc can now use a configuration file for special setups, or features
  activation. This file (/etc/nfc/libnfc.conf under GNU/Linux systems)
  supports already some keywords:
    - "allow_autoscan" to enable/disable device auto-detection feature;
    - "allow_intrusive_scan" to enable/disable intrusive auto-detection
      (ie. serial port probing);
    - "log_level" to select library verbosity;
    - "device.name" and "device.connstring" to define a user device,
      this is the recommended method if user has a not easily detectable
      device (ie. a serial one).
  It is also possible to define devices using dedicated configuration files and
  put them into device search directory (/etc/nfc/devices.d under GNU/Linux).
  Example for the OpenPCD2: create /etc/nfc/devices.d/openpcd2.conf with:
    name = "OpenPCD2"
    connstring = "pn532_uart:/dev/ttyACM0"
    optional = true
  The keyword "optional" does not mandate the device to be present always
  (it detects if the reader is indeed present before using it)

API Changes:

  * Types
    - New NFC_ESOFT error to handle software errors (allocations, pipe
      creation, etc.)

  * Functions
    - Remove nfc_get_default_device() function: the default device is now the
      first in nfc_list_devices() or could be open using NULL connstring with
      nfc_open() function.
    - New enum-to-string converter functions str_nfc_modulation_type() and
      str_nfc_baud_rate()
    - New str_nfc_target() to convert nfc_target struct into allocated string
    - New nfc_device_get_information_about() function to retreive some device's
      information
    - No more in/out function parameter: nfc_initiator_transceive_*() now
      take a constant size for Rx buffer
    - New nfc_initiator_target_is_present() to test is the previously selected
      target is available in the field
    - nfc_initiator_transceive_bytes() returns NFC_EMFCAUTHFAIL when AUTH
      command failed on a Mifare Classic
    - New nfc_initiator_init_secure_element() to initiate a connection with
      secure element (Only supported with a PN532 with SAM equipped)
